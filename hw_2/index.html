<h1>Corgi</h1>
<div class="row">
    <p>
        The Welsh Corgi is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales. The name "corgi" is derived
        from the Welsh words "cor" and "ci" (which is mutated to ‘gi’), meaning "dwarf" and "dog", respectively.

        Two separate breeds are recognised: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. There are physical
        differences between the two different breeds. According to the breed standards, overall the Cardigan is larger,
        both
        in weight and in height. Their tails are of different shapes, and docking had previously been performed.

<h1>Munchkin cat</h1>
<div class="row">
    <p>
        The Munchkin cat or Sausage cat is a relatively new breed of cat characterized by its very short legs, which are
        caused by genetic mutation. The Munchkin is considered to be the original breed of dwarf cat.

        Much controversy erupted over the breed when it was recognized by The International Cat Association (TICA) in
        1995 with critics voicing concern over potential health and mobility issues. Many pedigree cat associations
        around the world have refused to recognize the Munchkin cat due to the welfare of the breed and severity of the
        health issues, including the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy
